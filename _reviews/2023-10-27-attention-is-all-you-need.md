This is a seminal paper that introduced the **Transformer** architecture.

### Key Insights

1.  **Self-Attention**: Replaces recurrence with attention mechanisms.
2.  **Parallelization**: Allows for significantly faster training.

> "The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks..."

The paper demonstrates that attention mechanisms alone are sufficient for state-of-the-art performance in translation tasks.
